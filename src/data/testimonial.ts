      "It is a blessing to be taught by faculty who have themselves lived in the United States, but received their permission to teach from the great scholars of the Ummah over the last half of a century. This brings accuracy in information and light in transmission, and it is felt by the students. With regular attempts to keep student-teacher in person through majaalis and events, the institute thrives on using modern tools while retaining traditional etiquettes. It also succeeds in conserving Islamic values, while ensuring students feel liberated to express their religion with confidence within themselves, their families, and their communities.",

      "I am in the Alim course , 3rd year. I appreciate the amount of knowledge my teachers have and the fact that the experience of learning doesn't seem like the typical schooling system. Teachers know you by your name and the feel of the environment is not of students & teachers but of a family with brothers and sisters. Nothing needs improvement but I would just like the classes to become in-person. I feel that would be better for me specifically but the way MID is headed, they will need a big facility because the amount of individuals MID has the capability to set on the right path is very big inshaAllah",
